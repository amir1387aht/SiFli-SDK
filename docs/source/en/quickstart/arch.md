# Software Architecture

SiFli SDK is an officially provided software development framework customized based on RT-Thread. Using it, you can quickly develop applications running on SiFli Technology chip platforms.

The software framework is shown in the following diagram:
![](../../assets/sdk_arch_diagram.png)

- HAL is the Hardware Abstraction Layer, providing driver functionality independent of operating system services
- RT-Thread Device Driver is implemented based on HAL, providing higher-level encapsulation. Users do not need to implement interrupt service routines, making it easier to use. For a more detailed comparison between HAL and RT-Thread device drivers, please refer to [drivers.md](/app_development/drivers.md).
- Middleware (components) includes RT-Thread's built-in software components (such as finsh, ulog), third-party components (located in the `external` directory), and self-developed components (located in the `middleware` directory). Applications can use all service interfaces including HAL to develop applications.
